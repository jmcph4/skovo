# Skovo #
---

A simple Python time series library designed to wrap not only general time series (via `TimeSeries`) but also specific data sources (e.g. the [Australian Bureau of Statistics](http://abs.gov.au/), via `ABSTimeSeries`).

Skovo also provides database wrappers to save and otherwise manipulate time series data persistently. Skovo is designed to support scraping and other automated retrieval of time series datasets.
